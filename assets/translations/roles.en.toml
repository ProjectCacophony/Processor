__What is this?__\n\
The Roles module is used to allow users in your discord server to add and remove their own roles. This is especially useful for public servers with a large amount of members.\
\n\n__Basic set up__\n\
We'll go over the steps to get a basic role set up going, but if you just want to view all the commands in the roles modules you can run `{{ .prefix }}roles help`.\n\n\
First, you must determine which server roles you want your users to be able to manage. To do this run `{{ .prefix }}roles add role '<Role Name>'`. You can do this for as many roles as you like.\n\
Second, you will need to determine a channel used for role management. To do this run `{{ .prefix }}roles channel <channel>`. It's important the channel you chose is **only** used for roles, as any miscellaneous messages sent in the channel will be automatically deleted.\n\
Last, in your roles channel you'll need a message so users know what roles they can apply. The server mods can type their own if they wish or you can use the default message by running `{{ .prefix }}roles message` in your roles channel.\n\n\
You can do much more using role categories and applying limits, but that's all it takes to set up a basic roles channel.\
\n\n__Rules channel set up__\n\
In many larger servers they prefer to have users see a rules channel before accessing the rest of the server. We'll show how to set that up in the roles modules.\n\n\
First, you'll need to set another channel to work with roles. You can do this by creating a seporate roles category for that channel by running `{{ .prefix }}roles add category '<Category Name>' <channel>`.\n\
Second, add the role users will need to access the rest of your server by running `{{ .prefix }}roles add role '<Role Name>' '' '' '<Category Name>'`\
\n\n__Auto Roles__\n\
The Roles module can also be used to automatically assign a role to every user who joins the server. You can have the bot do this immediatly or after a set amount of time. To do this run `{{ .prefix }}roles auto add '<Role Name>' '<?Delay in seconds>'`\
