"roles.guide" = "__**Roles Guide**__\n\
The Roles module is used to allow users in your Discord server to manage their own roles. This is especially useful for public servers with a large amount of members.\
\n\n**Basic set up**\n\
We'll go over the steps to get a basic role set up going, but if you just want to view all the commands in the roles modules you can run `{{ .prefix }}roles help`.\n\n\
1) You must determine which server roles you want your users to be able to self manage. To do this run `{{ .prefix }}roles add role '<Role Name>'`. You can do this for as many server roles as you like.\n\
2) You will need to determine a channel used for role management. To do this run `{{ .prefix }}roles channel <channel>`. It's important the channel you chose is **only** used for roles, as any other messages sent in the channel will be automatically deleted.\n\
3) In your roles channel you'll need a message so users know what roles they can apply. The server mods can type their own if they wish or you can use the default message by running `{{ .prefix }}roles message` in your roles channel.\n\
That's all it takes to set up a basic roles channel! You can do much more such as using emojis reactions, setting up role categories and applying limits.\
